# Module 1: Local Development Environment

Upon completion a local editor, development tools, and clone of this repository will be setup locally on your laptop. Also, you will have verified all web sites and developer accounts needed.

First you will install the integrated development environment and supporting tools.

## Local Laptop Hygiene

In order to keep track of the various downloads, compiled code, etc., it is best to setup your directory structure ahead of time. The following are the default locations and recommendations prior to installing anything locally.

Here are the common terms used, location will be dependent upon Windows or macOS, each which have their own section below.

* **Download Directory** - The default location where files are downloaded from your web browser. Please clear out this directory, or make a subdirectory and move all previous downloads to that, to make it easier to track and find the downloads for this module.
* **BASE_DIR** - This is the base, or top level, of all the files you will clone from GitHub. Please place this as close to the top of your directory structure as possible. For all references, either `C:\tm_iot` (Windows) or `~/tm_iot` (macOS/Linux) will be used. Please adjust according to your actual location.

<p>

* **Download Directory** - Make sure you can open a Windows Explorer to this location and clean out or stash the existing files. You will have to navigate to this later.
* **BASE_DIR** - It is recommended to place this at the root of your C:\ drive, and name it `tm_iot` (e.g, `C:\tm_iot`).
* **How to add commands to your PATH** - [Here is a web page](https://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-10/add-windows-path-environment-variable/) that goes through this process. Please open or reference if needed.

</p></details>
<details>
<summary><strong>macOS laptop setup (exapand for details)</strong></summary>
<p>

* **Download Directory** - By default this is `~/Downloads`, where the `~` references your home directory.  Make sure you can open a Finder window to this location and clean out or stash the existing files. You will have to navigate to this later.
* **BASE_DIR** - It is recommended to place this at the root of your user directory and name it `tm_iot`. An easy way is to open a terminal session and follow these commands:

   ```bash
   $ cd ~
   $ mkdir tm_iot
   ```

* **How to add commands to your PATH** - [Here is a web page](https://blog.just2us.com/2011/05/setting-path-variable-in-mac-permanently/) that explains this process. Please open or reference in needed.

## Clone GitHub Repository

The final laptop setup process is to clone the repository to the workshop directory using git. When done, you will have the latest files (including this documentation) within the `tm_iot` directory.

1. Open a terminal and change directory to `tm_iot` (`C:\tm_iot` or `~/tm_iot` for Windows/macOS, respective)
2. Run the command to clone the directory: `git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/TinkerMill/workshop-ess-alexa-controlled-device.git`
3. Verify the directory `workshop-ess-alexa-controlled-device` exists and has content

Awesome! At this point you have installed all the basic software for the rest of the modules! It is common that since you are using a personal laptop, some of the instructions above may not be needed, may conflict, or may not work as expected. If steps don't seem to work properly, ask for assistance from others in the class or the workshop presenter.
