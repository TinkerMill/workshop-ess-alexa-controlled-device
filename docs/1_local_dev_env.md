# Lab 1: Local Development Environment

Upon completion a local editor, development tools, and clone of this repository will be setup locally on your laptop. Also, you will have verified all web sites and developer accounts needed.

First you will install the integrated development environment and supporting tools.

## Local Laptop Hygiene

In order to keep track of the various downloads, compiled code, etc., it is best to setup your directory structure ahead of time. The following are the default locations and recommendations prior to installing anything locally.

Here are the common terms used, location will be dependent upon Windows or macOS, each which have their own section below.

* **Download Directory** - The default location where files are downloaded from your web browser. Please clear out this directory, or make a subdirectory and move all previous downloads to that, to make it easier to track and find the downloads for this lab.
* **BASE_DIR** - This is the base, or top level, of all the files you will clone from GitHub. Please place this as close to the top of your directory structure as possible.

<p>

* **Download Directory** - Make sure you can open a Windows Explorer to this location and clean out or stash the existing files. You will have to navigate to this later.
* **BASE_DIR** - It is recommended to place this at the root of your C:\ drive, and name it `tm_iot`.
* **How to add commands to your PATH** - [Here is a web page](https://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-10/add-windows-path-environment-variable/) that goes through this process. Please open or reference if needed.

* **Download Directory** - By default this is `~/Downloads`, where the `~` references your home directory.  Make sure you can open a Finder window to this location and clean out or stash the existing files. You will have to navigate to this later.
* **BASE_DIR** - It is recommended to place this at the root of your user directory and name it `tm_iot`. An easy way is to open a terminal session and follow these commands:

   ```bash
   $ cd ~
   $ mkdir tm_iot
   ```

* **How to add commands to your PATH** - [Here is a web page](https://blog.just2us.com/2011/05/setting-path-variable-in-mac-permanently/) that explains this process. Please open or reference in needed.

:bulb: At this point you now have your laptop cleaned up and directory made to hold our code and supporting tools.


## Install Microsoft Visual Studio Code

From a browser navigate to the [installation page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and download and run the installer locally. This will install VSCode and make it available to launch from your Applications list.

1. [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) VSCode and install
2. Run VSCode and perform any required updates

<details>
<summary><strong>VSCode Installation Instructions (exapand for details)</strong></summary>
<p>

1. [Download the installer package](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for your operating systems, 64-bit is recommended

1. Run the installer and modify the *Select Additional Tasks* to allow VSCode to interact from Windows Explorer:

## Install Python 3

All development will use the Python 3 language and some additional packages (modules) to work with your local code. If you already have Python 3.x installed with pip, you can skip these steps. It is recommended to run Python in a virtual environment where possible. Instructions here do *not* take that into consideration.

:exclamation: If you think you already have some version of Python 3 installed, ask for assistance to ensure the commands below do not affect you existing projects and environment.

1. [Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) Python 3.7 for your operating system
2. Install and add the Python directory to your path
3. Test and ensure `python3` runs with the correct version

<details>
<summary><strong>Install Python 3 for Windows (exapand for details)</strong></summary>
<p>

1. Download the Python 3.7.0  installer package [from the main download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [64-bit is recommended - direct link](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.0/python-3.7.0-amd64.exe)

1. Run the installer:

   ![lab1_1](lab1_3.png)

   1. Select *Add Python 3.7 to PATH*
   2. Click *Install Now*

1. Click the *Disable path length limit**:

   ![lab1_4](lab1_4.png)

1. Once VSCode has restarted, you can verify python is running by creating a terminal `CTRL-SHIFT-~` and typing `python` at the prompt:

   ```powershell
   C:\tm_iot>python
   Python 3.7.0 (v3.7.0:1bf9cc5093, Jun 27 2018, 04:59:51) [MSC v.1914 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
   Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
   >>>
   ```

<p>

1. Download the Python 3.7.0  installer package [from the main download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

1. Run the installer and take off of the defaults. At the end, a Finder window will open. **If this is your first installation of Python 3, double-click the `Update Shell Profile.command` document.**

1. Restart VSCode and verify python is running by creating a terminal ``CTRL-SHIFT-` `` and typing `python3` at the prompt:

   ```bash
   $ python3
   Python 3.7.0 (v3.7.0:1bf9cc5093, Jun 26 2018, 23:26:24)

## Install Serial Driver

To flash and communicate with the MCU, a serial driver needs to be installed. This is different process for Windows and macOS. Once completed you will note the communication port used.

1. [Download](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers) the SiLabs CP210x driver for your operating system
1. Once installed, connect the MCU with the USB cable
1. Open your Device Settings for the new COMx port (Windows) or an new `/dev/cu.*` device
1. Note this value in a new scratch document

<details>
<summary><strong>Install serial driver for Windows (exapand for details)</strong></summary>
<p>

1. [Download](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers) the SiLabs CP210x driver for your version of Windows

1. GAA - install driver
1. open device management
1. note serial ports
1. connect MCU
1. note new serial port and save

</p></details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Install serial driver for macOS (exapand for details)</strong></summary>
<p>

1. [Download](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers) the SiLabs CP210x driver for your version of macOS

1. Run the installer and take all the defaults

   :exclamation: For newer versions of macOS, you may have to go into *System Preferences->Security & Privacy->General* and click to allow the driver to have access

1. Open a terminal and lis the current devices:

   ```bash
   $ ls /dev/cu.*
   /dev/cu.Bluetooth-Incoming-Port
   $
   ```

1. Now connect the MCU and perform the same listing:

   ```bash
   $ ls /dev/cu.*
   /dev/cu.Bluetooth-Incoming-Port	/dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART
   ```

1. Note new serial port (in this example `/dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART`) and save.
